📧 Spam Email Classifier (Machine Learning Project)

This project is a Spam Email Classification system built using Python and Machine Learning.
It was completed as part of my Machine Learning Internship with InternCred, with a focus on applying Natural Language Processing (NLP) concepts to a real-world problem.

📌 Project Overview

Spam emails are a common issue in digital communication.
The goal of this project is to automatically classify email messages as Spam or Ham (Not Spam) using machine learning techniques.

The project follows the end-to-end machine learning pipeline, from data preprocessing to model evaluation.

🎯 Objectives

Understand and preprocess text data for machine learning

Convert text into numerical features using TF-IDF Vectorization

Train a supervised learning model for text classification

Evaluate model performance using appropriate metrics

🧠 Machine Learning Workflow


Data Loading


Loaded an SMS spam dataset into a Pandas DataFrame


Data Cleaning & Preparation


Renamed relevant columns for clarity


Removed unnecessary columns


Encoded target labels (Spam / Ham)




Text Preprocessing


Cleaned and transformed raw text data


Prepared text for feature extraction




Feature Engineering


Used TF-IDF Vectorizer to convert text into numerical features




Model Training


Trained a Logistic Regression classifier on the processed data




Model Evaluation


Evaluated performance using accuracy and classification metrics


Tested predictions on new input messages





🛠️ Tools & Technologies


Python


Pandas


NumPy


Scikit-learn


TF-IDF Vectorization


Random Forest


Jupyter Notebook



📊 Results


The model successfully classifies messages as Spam or Ham


Demonstrates that simple models can perform well with proper preprocessing


Highlights the importance of feature engineering in NLP tasks
